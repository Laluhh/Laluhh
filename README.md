hi!! Ty for reading I am super lazy to decor this
Ts all you get ok?.. Ok? Ok ok
Call me laluh please!! Use he/him I'm trans and also aroace!! I'm a diagnosed ADHD and I'm 15! don't be weird

please call me laluhh or any nickname u give me just not call me lala unless I allow you to lalalala

Idm dirty/sex jokes!! Just know ur limit! If I'm uncomfortable I always shut up or just back off yeah I might look into it but I am mostly NOT

IWC when I'm with my CLOSE friends ok?.. idm talking but when I really want some space I usually back away from everyone

know ur limit I am not the type of person that want to hear ur vents/rants but I do offer comfort and distraction ^^

I don't really enjoy talking too much sometimes I'm non verbal since I'm super nervous when I'm with new people

please don't add me randomly or inv me to a party randomly! Since I'm already in a party and don't really want to make new friends!

I don't int first please if I'm alone feel free to int idm! But sadly I'll be in class or quiet most of the time I probably don't have any response

I really get overwhelmed and get sad easily if so many people talk to me I would get really frustrated and honestly uncomfortable ^^
